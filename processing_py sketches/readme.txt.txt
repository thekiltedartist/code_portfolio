While Processing.Py is not strictly Python, it is however an example of 
Object Oriented Programming in action using Python syntax. As most assignmets will be working within an
established codebase, these little Processing.Py sketches demostrate using a OOP framework
without needing to know what the rest of the codebase actually does, but instead knowing
how to use the class and functions provided. Hopefully these experiments and tinkering
are able to show this.
